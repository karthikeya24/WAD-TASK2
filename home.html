            Instagram is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos with their 
            followers. It was launched in October 2010 and quickly gained widespread popularity, especially among 
            younger users.<br><br>
            Instagram enables users to upload photos and videos, apply filters to them, and share them on their 
            profile or with a select group of people.<br><br> Users can follow other accounts to see their posts in their 
            feed, and they can also interact with posts by liking, commenting, and sharing them. Instagram has 
            features like Stories, IGTV (Instagram TV), and Reels, which offer additional ways for users to share 
            content.
