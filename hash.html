        <p class="matter">Open the Instagram app on your mobile device (or go to <b>Instagram.com</b>) and sign in to start using Instagram search.<br><br>

            Instagram search is located on the Explore tab of the Instagram app. 
            To access search, tap the magnifying glass icon in the bottom menu. <br>
            A search box appears at the top that says Search.
            Tap the search to display the keyboard.
            <br><br>
            On Instagram.com, the Instagram search field is at the top of your home feed as soon as you sign in.</p>
            <img src="hash1.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="img">
            <p class="matter">In the Instagram search field, enter your search. Four tabs appear at the top: Top, Accounts, Tags, and Places.
                <br><br>
                To search for a tag, search for it with or without the hashtag symbol <b>(such as #photooftheday or photooftheday)</b>. 
                After typing your tag search term, either choose the result you were looking for from the automatic list of top suggestions 
                or tap the Tags tab to filter the results that aren't tags.
                <br><br>
                Instagram.com doesn't have the same four search result tabs that the app has, making it harder to filter results. 
                When you type a tag search term, a list of suggested results appears in a drop-down list. Some of these results are tags 
                (marked by the hashtag—#—symbol) and others are user accounts (marked by their profile photos).</p>
                <img src="hash2.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="img">
            <p class="matter">After you tap a tag from the Tags tab on the app or click on a suggested tag from the drop-down menu on Instagram.com, 
                you're shown a grid of photos and videos that were tagged and posted by Instagram users in real time.
                <br><br>
                A selection of top posts, which are posts with the most likes and comments, displays in the default tab on the app and at the top on Instagram.com. 
                Switch to the Recent tab on the app to see the recent posts for that tag in the app or scroll past the first nine posts on Instagram.com.</p>
